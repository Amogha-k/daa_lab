/*
DigiMap services is a module in G-Maps which is used to find the distance from
one place to another or from your location to the nearest desired location. This
requires the Shortest Path Algorithm, as there are various routes/paths
connecting them but it has to show the minimum distance. . Represent a
city/place with a vertex and the route between two cities/places as an edge,
then by using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, find the shortest routes between any two
cities/places or from one city/place to another city/place.
