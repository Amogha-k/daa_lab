/*
Consider the Subset sum problem in which the objective is to find subset of 
elements that are selected from a given set whose sum adds up to a given 
number K. Assume the set contains non-negative values and also the input set 
is unique (no duplicates are present.). Design and develop a program in C to
find the subset of a given set whose sum is equal to a positive integer K and 
display an appropriate message if the given problem instance does not have the 
solution. Note : Use Backtracking method.
